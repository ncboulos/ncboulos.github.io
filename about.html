          <div id="aboutcopy">
            <p>I'm an experienced writer, editor and translator with a demonstrated history working in media production, international development and hospitality. I've worked as a journalist and magazine editor in Haiti, my home country, and in New York City. I recently joined the University of Miami Development Communications team as a Communications Specialist. I focus on producing, curating, and copyediting content for the UM Development and Alumni Relations online platforms and social media networks.</p>

            <p>Prior to joining the University of Miami, I lived and worked as a translator in Mexico City. I hold a bachelor’s degree in English and international development from the George Washington University and a master’s degree in journalism from Columbia University.</p>
